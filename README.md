# icebreaker-women
"Who Am I?" Icebreaker cards featuring female leaders. The game goes like this:

- You print out the cards and cut them out.
- As participants enter the meeting / networking event / etc., you tape one of 
the cards to their back (don't let them know what theirs says!)
- The participants can begin to mingle by asking others questions about the
person's name taped to their back. They can ask yes or no questions about
the person to try to figure out who it is. 
- Participants can only take off their card when they've correctly guessed 
who it is.
- You can then collect the cards of those who correctly guessed into a 
jar or such and have some kind of raffle. 

You can take this game a lot of different ways, but it's a good, low-stress way
for a group of people to network and meet others.

# How the files work

Basically there's a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet (the ODS file) that has the
list of women's names and their description (in case the person answering
the questions doesn't know much about the person.)

I saved that out as the CSV file (included,) then opened up the glabels
file (http://www.glabels.org/) to generate the printable sheets (included PDF.)

# Modifying the files

If you want to make any edits to the cards or add your own, here's the steps
I suggest:

- Modify either the CSV file (you can use your spreadsheet program of choice to
do this, I of course recommend LibreOffice calc), then save your additions 
/ modifications / etc. to CSV format from that app.

- Install glabels, open up the glabels file, go to the 
Objects > Merge Properties menu, and select your new CSV file and hit okay.

- Print the sheet from glabels (you can print to PDF or directly to the 
printer.)

- Cut your cards out and have fun!

# Submitting additions

Please feel free to submit additions to this set, I am very happy to receive
pull requests. Please keep your modifications to the CSV file.
